        <p class="skillset-description">
          I started my design journey with motion design in my college days.
          Motion is something that really fascinates me because of the
          flexibility of story telling.

        <p class="skillset-description">
          Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography
          really makes you look and percieve things in a different way.
